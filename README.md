# Advanced-Computer-Science
Advanced Software Engineering Project

This project is developed for course which encourage students to agile development and simulate real industry problems.

## Getting Started

You can clone the repo and see one by one our milestones of our project.
```
git clone https://github.com/Hsgngr/Advanced-Computer-Science
cd Project-v3  //Example
npm start
```

### Prerequisites

* If you run this project on an android emulator, You should install Android Studio and set up a virtual device.

* If you run on your own device, you need to install expo app to your physical device.

```
npm install expo-cli
```

### Installing
The folders that you can run "npm start" in:
  1)minimumDelivarable
  2)Project-v3
  3)task4

```
cd minimumDelivrable
npm start
```
To run the task4 there are more things you should do, since it needs a local server and ngrok also. You need 3 different cmd prompt

```
cd track-server
npm run dev
```
For every 8 hours you should change the url in Advanced-Computer-Science\task4\src\api\tracker.js
BaseURL: '<yourURl>'
  
```
ngrok http 3000
```
By running npm start in repository will open a localhost in your browser where you can scan the qr code with your device or connect virtual devices 

```
npm start
```
