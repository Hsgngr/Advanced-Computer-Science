## Getting Started

You can clone the repo and see one by one our milestones of our project.
```
git clone https://github.com/Hsgngr/Advanced-Computer-Science
cd Project-v3  //Example
npm start
```

### Prerequisites

* If you run this project on an android emulator, You should install Android Studio and set up a virtual device.

* If you run on your own device, you need to install expo app to your physical device.

  1)minimumDelivarable
  2)Project-v3
  3)task4
  4)tracks

```
cd minimumDelivrable
npm start
```
To run the task4 there are more things you should do, since it needs a local server and ngrok also. You need 3 different cmd prompt

```
cd track-server
npm run dev
```
  To run the tracks (newest version of our app) 
```
cd tracks/
npm start
```
